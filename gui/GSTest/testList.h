// If you want to write a new test, read this.
//

//
// Each test is stored in a bundle.
// A bundle is a bunch of resources (executable stuff too)
// which can be dinamically loaded at run-time.
//

//
// When the user selects a test from the menu for the first time,
// the main program looks for the corresponding bundle, and
// loads the "principal Class" of that bundle.  (which class is the
// principal class is specified in the GNUmakefile for that bundle).
// An instance of this principal Class is allocated and initialized.
// This should run the test, usually creating windows, gui objects, etc.
//
// Afterwards, each time the user selects the test again,
// the main program sends a "-restart" message to this instance of the
// principal class.  The expected behaviour is that -restart should
// bring all the windows to front.  If the test wants, it may also reset
// values to defaults or whatever.
//
// Releasing of tests after use would be easy to implement, but not really
// useful, so not implemented by now.
//

//
// This file contains the list of currently implemented test.
//

// Number of tests in the list
#define TEST_NUMBER 23
